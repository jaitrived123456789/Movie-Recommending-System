# Movie-Recommending-System
It's a Movie recommendation web application which is built using python programming and streamlit library using PyCharm and deployed on streamlit cloud. 
It's main objective is to simplify the recommendation system for any organization or a person so that he/she could get the desired recommendations without wasting
time searching randomly. We have utilised many python libraries during this project and also worked on PyCharm so that we could creat a web app.
Some of the libraries are Streamlit, Pandas, Numpy, requests, pickle, etc.
We have hosted the application onn Streamlit cloud so that anyone can use it according to their needs and utilise its facilities.
